I have products in db, each product is in what I call "view category". 
The mapping in db is 1-n. 

I am creating "main category" in the db and need to map products to a main category, this mapping must be 1-1. 

You will be provided with list of products and list of their view categories. 

Your job is to map a product to main category. 
Use the name (this is product name), parent_categories and sub_categories to determine main category for each product 
The main category is defined and can only be mapped to the defined main categories.
